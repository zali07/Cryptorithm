  <h2>AES Origin</h2>
  <p>
    AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), also known as Rijndael, is a symmetric
    block cipher cryptosystem, which was standardized by the NIST in 2001. The
    system was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Vincent Rijmen and Joan
    Daemen, and the name Rijndael is a contraction of their names.
  </p>
  <p>
    The block ciphers are schemes for encryption or decryption where a block of
    plaintext is treated as a single block and is used to obtain a block of
    ciphertext with the same size. Today, AES is one of the most used algorithms
    for block encryption. The size of an AES block is 128 bits, whereas the size
    of the encryption key can be 128, 192 or 256 bits. Please note this, there
    is three length in the key, but the size of the encryption block always is
    128 bits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Five modes: ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR
    <br />
    In this case we are discussing the CTR (short for counter) mode. At this
    mode of operation as an input block to the encryptor, i.e. as an IV, the
    value of a counter (Counter, Counter + 1,â€¦, Counter + N - 1) is used. It
    also is a stream encryptor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pros:
    <br />
    - No padding
    <br />
    - Supports parallel computing
    <br />
    - Encryption and decryption use the same structure
    <br />
    - Bad block only affect the current block
    <br />
    Cons:
    <br />
    - A MITM (Man in the Middle) can change some ciphertext damaged plaintext

  <h2>AES-CTR Description</h2>
  <p>
    A secret symmetric key is generated or provided. The AES algorithm takes
    this key and expands it into a set of round keys that will be used in the
    subsequent encryption process.
  </p>
  <p>
    An Initialization Vector is a unique value that is required for the CTR
    mode. The IV can be generated randomly or derived from a nonce (number used
    once) and a counter. The IV should be unique for each encryption operation
    to maintain security. The counter value is initialized based on the IV. The
    counter is a unique value that is incremented for each block of plaintext or
    ciphertext.
  </p>
  <p>
    AES-CTR operates by dividing the plaintext into fixed-size blocks (e.g., 128
    bits). For each block, the counter value is encrypted using the AES
    algorithm and the round keys generated in the key expansion phase. This
    encryption of the counter produces a pseudorandom keystream.
  </p>
  <p>
    The pseudorandom keystream generated from the encryption step is then XORed
    with the corresponding plaintext block. The result of the XOR operation is
    the ciphertext block. This process is repeated for each block of plaintext,
    generating the complete ciphertext.
  </p>
  <p>
    After each encryption or decryption operation, the counter value is
    incremented to ensure that a unique value is used for each block.
    <br />
    By using this process, AES-CTR transforms the AES block cipher into a stream
    cipher, generating a pseudorandom keystream that is combined with the
    plaintext or ciphertext through the XOR operation.

  <h2>AES-CTR Security</h2>
  <p>
    To ensure security, the key in this mode need to be changed for every
    2^(n/2) encryption blocks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Attack modes:
    <br />
    - PA (Padding Attack)
    <br />
    - CPA (Chose Plaintext Attack)
    <br />
    - CCA (Choosen Ci)
  </p>
  <p>
    It's commonly useid in:
    <br />
    - Network Communication
    <br />
    - Disk and File Encryption
    <br />
    - Cloud Storage
    <br />
    - Real-Time Media Encryption
    <br />
    - Wireless Security
