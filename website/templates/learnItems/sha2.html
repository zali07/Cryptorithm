  <h2>SHA-2 Origin</h2>
  <p>
    The successor of <a href="/learning/sha1">SHA-1</a>, approved and
    recommended by NIST, SHA-2 is a family of six algorithms with different
    digest sizes (in bits): SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224,
    SHA-512/256. The first four use the same construction with different output
    sizes, while the last two are truncated versions of SHA-512, where the
    initial values are generated using the method described in
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards"
      target="_blank"
      >FIPS 180-4</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Three main purposes of a hash function are:
    <br />
    - To scramble data deterministically
    <br />
    - To accept an input of arbitrary length and output a fixed-length result
    <br />
    - To manipulate data irreversibly
  </p>
  <p>
    The input cannot be derived from the output SHA-2 is a strong family of hash
    functions because, as you would expect, it serves all the purposes mentioned
    above.

  <h2>SHA-2 Description</h2>
  <p>
    The input message is processed in blocks of 512 bits. If the message length
    is not a multiple of 512 bits, padding is added to the message to bring it
    to the appropriate length. The padding includes a "1" bit followed by a
    series of "0" bits, and the length of the original message is appended.
  </p>
  <p>
    The buffer is represented as eight 32-bit registers (A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
    H).
  </p>
  <p>
    The message is broken into 512 bits chunks, and each chunk goes through a
    complex process and 64 rounds of compression. The value obtained after each
    compression is added to the current hash value.
  </p>
  <p>
    The final hash value or digest is concatenated (linked together) based on
    all of the chunk values resulting from the processing step.

  <h2>SHA-2 Security / Usage</h2>
  <p>
    SHA-2 is known for its security (it hasn't broken down like SHA-1) and its
    speed. In cases where keys are not generated, such as proof-of-work Bitcoin
    mining, a fast hash algorithm like SHA-2 often has the upper hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    SHA-256 is useful in so many circumstances! It's a fast and secure hash
    function, here are some of the most common ways that it's used:
    <br />
    - To create website authentication schemes, using JWTs, HMACs and MACs
    <br />
    - To create digital signatures
    <br />
    - To secure blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum
    <br />
    - In anti-viruses, to compare the fingerprints of files and programs
    <br />
    - In version control systems like Git to check if data has changed
  </p>
  <p>After all, in SHA-256 there are 2^256 possible outputs.</p>
